            I currently work as a full stack Web Developer on the FortiDeceptor team.
            <br>We identify, deceive, and capture network attacks! 
            <br>For the features that I implement I often define and design them as well.

          <p>
            In this role I managed projects and developed medical technology solutions in a multidisciplinary collective of healthcare practitioners and engineers.
            <br>Over the course of my time in this position, I was involved with over 8 different projects and accumulated various pending patents as well as journal authorships. 
            <br>I owned the development of, but not limited to, the following:
            <br>●	Owned the development of PatientLink, a web app that provides direct updates of a patient’s status from the surgical team to friends and family, helping to ease waiting room anxiety as well as reduce reliance on hospital staff. (Node.js)
            <br>●	Developed an Android application to record correlations between hand tremors and residual medications measured in a patient to provide a method of accurately administering drugs and minimizing side effects caused by excessive dosages.
            <br>●	Built POC to aid in preventing potentially fatal errors where surgical items are left in the patient by using computer vision to recognize and track surgical items circulating in an operating room. (OpenCV and TensorFlow)
            <br>Some of my responsibilities also included competitive research, customer discovery, and the overseeing volunteer researchers.

            During an 8-month long intensive venture design program, I led a multidisciplinary team of 5 engineering and commerce students. 
            Our team consisted of myself in computer engineering as well a teammate in materials engineering, a double major in kinesiology and business, as well as two individuals from the commerce program.
            <br>We started off by identifying customer pains in the form of bra fit and breast pain leading to the development of an MVP web application to 
                match users with suggested bra designs applying a user’s self-reported pains and breast characteristics as input.
            <br>For the development side of things, as the only teammate with software experience I implemented the web application while guiding my teammates 
                in the usage of SQL to build a database of bra characteristics. With a tight timeline for demo-day, our web application was built with the features
                for the user to input their chest measurements and select common, specific issues they had with bras in the mainstream market. Our hope was to utilize
                Computer Vision and enhanced security to take a 3D model of chests and match them to their best bras.
            <br>Through the course of the project I led the team through product pivots as well as the market research and the development of user requirements, 
                release plans, marketing strategies, and financial projections.
